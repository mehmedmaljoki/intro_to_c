There are many doors here. I once tried counting them and I think there are 12165 doors in this labyrinth.
Too many to check all of them manually.

If I was looking for Gold I would try using 'ls' to peek multiple doors at the same time.

   ls door*/Gold.txt

and then go where the Gold.txt was found.
