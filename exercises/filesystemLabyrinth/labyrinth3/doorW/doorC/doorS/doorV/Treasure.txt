We are in labyrinth3 but this is actually the Treasure for labyrinth6.

As this is the last piece of Treasure, you solved all labyrinths.
Try building your own labyrinth using the following commands

    mkdir # to create directories
    nano  # to create text files
    ln    # to create symlinks (option -s)
    mv    # to change the name and/or location of files and directories, we all make mistakes
