First type in this command

      source tools.sh

It will set up a few helper functions.

Try navigating these "labyrinths".

start with the first by going into it:

	cd labyrinth1

use "ls", "cd" and "cat" to find "Treasure.txt"
When you find it, try the next labyrinth

If you just use "ls", "cd" and "cat" (without >) you can not break anything. Don't worry.

If your path gets really long, you may be able to make it shorter again by calling

   cleanupWorkingDir

(type "clean" and then press Tab, if you don't want to type the whole thing)
cleanupWorkingDir will be helpful after you cleared the first labyrinth.

if you like, you can try hardMode:

   hardMode
   hardMode yes
