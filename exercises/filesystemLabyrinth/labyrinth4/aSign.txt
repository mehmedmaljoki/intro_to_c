Just always take doorA, but that might take a while.

There is a shortcut but it is broken.
Let's check

    ls -l

to find out what's wrong with the brokenShortcut.

And we can also use the power of while.

Let's try if first: Go into doorA if it exists:

    if [ -d doorA ]
    then
        cd doorA
    fi

The spaces around '-d' and the '[' and ']' are important.
'[' and ']' are also called 'test'. See

    man test

if you want to know more. (Exit man by pressing q)

A while loop looks like this:

    while condition
    do
        echo "in loop"
    done

(stop an infinite loop using Ctrl-C)
